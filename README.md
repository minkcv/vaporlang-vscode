# vaporlang extension for VSCode

Vaporlang is a language created for developing for the [Vapor Spec](https://github.com/minkcv/vm) virtual game platform. The language doesn't have a grammar and is rather haphazardly thrown together. This extension provides syntax highlighting for vaporlang in VSCode.
